# Economic Classification Analysis: Beyond GNI Per Capita

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of economic classification systems, challenging the traditional reliance on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita as the sole criterion for classifying national economies.

## Research Question

**By which criteria should we classify economies? Does division based on GNI per capita levels make sense?**

## Project Overview

Traditional economic classification systems rely heavily on GNI per capita, which masks important dimensions of development. This project develops a multidimensional development index built on 7 equally weighted thematic dimensions:

1. **Income & Output** - GDP, GDP per capita, GNI per capita, GNI per capita at PPP
2. **Infrastructure & Technology** - Industry value added, electric power consumption, mobile subscriptions, high-technology exports
3. **Trade & Investment** - FDI inflows, trade ratios, gross capital formation
4. **Human Capital** - Education enrollment rates, business registration procedures
5. **Environmental** - COâ‚‚ emissions, forest area, water productivity, agricultural value added
6. **Institutional Factors** - Military expenditure, debt service, ODA, remittances
7. **Health** - HIV prevalence, under-5 mortality, immunization coverage, life expectancy

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals that multidimensional measurement can unearth policy-relevant distinctions that GNI classification would obscure, such as:
- Middle-income countries with robust human capital but weak infrastructure
- Countries with similar GNI per capita but vastly different development profiles
- The importance of non-monetary dimensions in sustainable development

## Data Sources

The analysis uses World Bank Development Indicators (WDI) data, including:
- Economic indicators (GDP, GNI, trade data)
- Social indicators (education, health metrics)
- Environmental indicators (emissions, natural resources)
- Institutional indicators (governance, financial flows)

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Automated collection from World Bank API
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, standardization, and imputation
3. **Dimensional Analysis**: Development of 7 thematic dimensions
4. **Statistical Modeling**: Clustering and classification analysis
5. **Visualization**: Comprehensive charts and interactive plots
6. **Policy Implications**: Analysis of classification differences

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`
3. Open the HTML file for the complete analysis
4. Or run the Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration
